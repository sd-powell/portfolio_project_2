Testing was conducted continuously throughout the development process to ensure a functional and user-friendly website. Chrome Developer Tools were extensively utilised during the build to identify and resolve issues promptly. Regular testing allowed for a smoother development process and ensured the final product met quality standards.

Throughout the development process, ChatGPT was utilised as a valuable resource for brainstorming ideas, refining content, and troubleshooting challenges. By offering alternative solutions and best practices, ChatGPT contributed significantly to the websiteâ€™s overall quality and functionality.

Each page is tested using Chrome Developer Tools to ensure that it is responsive on a variety of different screen sizes and devices.
