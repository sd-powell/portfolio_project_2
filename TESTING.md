Testing was an **integral part of the development process**, ensuring the website remained both **functional and user-friendly** at every stage. By conducting **continuous testing**, potential issues were identified early, allowing for swift resolution and a more efficient workflow.

**Chrome Developer Tools** played a crucial role throughout development, providing real-time insights into performance, responsiveness, and debugging. This proactive approach helped streamline development and ensure the final product adhered to high-quality standards.

Additionally, **ChatGPT** served as a key resource for refining ideas, optimizing content, and overcoming technical challenges. By offering structured guidance, best practices, and alternative solutions, it contributed to improving both the efficiency of development and the overall quality of the final product.

To guarantee **cross-device compatibility**, every page was rigorously tested across various **screen sizes and devices** using Chrome Developer Tools. This process ensured the quiz was fully responsive, providing a seamless user experience across **desktops, tablets, and mobile devices**.

## AUTOMATED TESTING

<a id=w3c-validation></a>

### W3C Validator

[W3C](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to validate the HTML on all pages of the website.

| Directory | File tested | Screenshot | Notes |
| --------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----- |
| documentation/testing-w3c-home.webp | index.html | ![screenshot](documentation/testing-w3c-home.webp) | no errors occurred when checking |

### CSS Validator

[CSS W3C Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) was used to validate my CSS file.

<a id=js-validation></a>

### JavaScript Validator

The [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) website was used to validate the JavaScript code. I also installed [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), which automatically checked my JavaScript code in the console and reported any errors.  

I attempted to test with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/), but I encountered complications when importing functions into my test scripts. After assessing the time required to resolve these issues, I decided it would be more efficient to use alternative testing methods.

| Validator| Issues found | Fix Implemented |
| :--: | :-- | :-- |
| **JSHint** | One warning `117	'async functions' is only available in ES8 (use 'esversion: 8').` | JSHint is warning you that async functions are only supported in ES8 (ECMAScript 2017), but it is currently set to an older ECMAScript version. I updated the JSHint configuration to ES8. |
| **ESLint** | One error `297:5 error 'Swal' is not defined no-undef` | I researched this issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/sweetalert2/sweetalert2/issues/477) and it should be resolved by declaring the link to the sweetalert2 CDN in `√¨ndex.html` |

<a id=lighthouse></a>

### Lighthouse

I've tested my deployed project using the Lighthouse Audit tool to test the performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO of the website.

<a id=responsiveness></a>

### Responsiveness

In addition to testing my deployed site on different devices, I thoroughly tested its responsiveness using Chrome Developer Tools.  
I researched the **narrowest width of modern devices** on [Stack Exchange](https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/74798/are-there-devices-narrower-than-320px-and-data-on-their-usage-for-web-browsing) and based my testing on **320px** as a standard minimum width.  
Additionally, I used the [Mobile First Plugin](https://www.webmobilefirst.com/en/), a Chrome extension designed to test site responsiveness across different devices.
