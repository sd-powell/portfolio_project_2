### Colour Scheme

The site's color scheme draws inspiration from the vibrant neon lights of a 1970s disco, featuring bold, electrifying hues that evoke the energy, excitement, and retro-futuristic aesthetics of the era. The glowing, high-contrast palette enhances the immersive experience, creating a visually dynamic atmosphere reminiscent of classic dance floors, shimmering reflections, and the iconic nightlife of the time.

The primary colours for the site are

To enhance user engagement and guide attention to important areas, I incorporated distinct highlight colors:

- `4f9aff` (Bright Blue): Used to emphasize key UI elements, drawing user focus to interactive components.
- `e83c5a` (Red): Clearly signals an incorrect answer, creating an instant visual cue for mistakes.
- `4eb738` (Green): Indicates a correct answer, reinforcing success with a positive color association.
- `f59527` (Gold): Represents the user’s score, evoking achievement and reward with a warm, celebratory tone.

This color scheme enhances clarity, feedback, and user experience while maintaining a cohesive, vibrant aesthetic.

### Typography

Google Fonts was used to import the selected fonts for the site, ensuring high-quality and easily accessible typography.

- **h1, h2 and h3 headings** The font [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto?preview.text=Think%20you%20know%20your%20music%3F) was chosen because it offers a clean, modern, and highly readable design that enhances user experience while maintaining a professional and contemporary look.

- **paragraph elements:** The font [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter) was chosen as a font pairing for Roboto because its geometric yet friendly design complements Roboto’s modern aesthetic, ensuring a harmonious and highly readable typography combination for my site.

![Inter Font Example](documentation/type-inter.webp)

- **social media icons:** [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) library icons were used throughout the site because they provide a versatile, scalable, and visually consistent icon set that enhances usability and complements the clean, modern aesthetic of my typography.

### Imagery

I chose neon imagery for my site because it’s a pop quiz, and I wanted to reflect the fun, energetic vibe of an ’80s neon disco theme. The vibrant glow and retro-futuristic aesthetic create an engaging, nostalgic atmosphere that makes the quiz experience feel exciting and immersive.
